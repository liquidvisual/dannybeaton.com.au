			<p class="lv-drop-cap">Danny has been writing and drawing since he could put crayon to paper. There are some people who are born to write, and some people who are born to be Zoo Keepers, Danny has never believed in keeping animals behind bars so he became a writer.</p>

			<p>Heâ€™s written movies, short stories and even a poem or two, but the crowning jewel in his pile of work is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/books/">Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners</a>. This book was conceived at the last minute for a writing assignment in High School and has since exploded from imagination to print.</p>

			<p>Being a writer, Danny values creativity and strives to bring this out in others. He is currently touring schools in Victoria, Australia with his creative workshop Reading, Writing and Mal Winter.
			Danny is currently writing Mal Winter and the Last Titan, which is expected to be released July 2015.</p>
