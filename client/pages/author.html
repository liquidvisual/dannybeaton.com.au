				<p class="lv-drop-cap">Danny has been writing and drawing since he could put crayon to paper. There are some people who are born to write, and some people who are born to be Zoo Keepers, Danny has never believed in keeping animals behind bars so he became a writer.</p>

				<p>He has written movies, short stories and even a poem or two, but the crowning jewel in his body of work is his latest book, <b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/store/">Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners</a></b>.</p>

				<p>Danny values creativity and strives to bring this out in others. He's currently touring schools in Victoria, Australia with a creative workshop that promotes reading and creative writing.</p>
