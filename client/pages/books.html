			<p>Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners has been a story in the making since as far back as 2004, where the idea was born. Since then Danny has been writing, studying writing and talking about writing to further develop his craft and tell his stories. This book is the accumulation of a lifetime of work, and represents the best the not-so-young Danny Beaton has to offer. </p>
