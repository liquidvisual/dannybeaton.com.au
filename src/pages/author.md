<p class="lv-drop-cap lead">
We don’t always end up where we start and I didn’t start out as a writer. My ‘thing’ was drawing, I did comic book action panels, illustrated amazing heroic and monstrous characters and designed new worlds. I kept drawing until my stories could no longer be contained in a picture, so I turned to words and decided to be an author.

“Yeah, that could be fun,” I remember thinking. Such an idiot. Writing seems easy, you look at great authors and it looks simple, words on a page telling a story. But I wasn’t very good. I spent years writing a few manuscripts, short stories and even studying a Bachelor of Arts and majoring in writing. Writing was never easier, but eventually it was less hard.

[Mal Winter and the Cloud Runners](/books/) is the first book I published, and is an urban fantasy that is the product of effort, time and then some more effort and more time. The story was conceived to tell a fantastic story to an otherwise ordinary boy, and take readers on a wild adventure ride with its hero. It’s been out since the end of 2014, and now I’m completing the follow up, **Mal Winter and the Last Titan**.

I’m also working on another epic novel series, the first book is titled **Seeds of Equilibrium** and it is set in a dark, futuristic world following two young boys who are destined to change the very universe itself.

Beyond books, I’ve written screenplays, short stories and non-fiction articles. From that I won a flash fiction writing competition, had a script turned into a film (Blood Hunt) and had stories published in the Deakin Wordly magazine.
