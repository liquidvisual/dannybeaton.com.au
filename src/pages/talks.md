<p class="lv-drop-cap">Danny's passion for reading, writing and telling stories has inspired him to create a seminar targeting Primary School children. His seminar aims to awaken and develop skills and interest in creative writing from an early age using
interactive workshops, engaging children about what they read and why.</p>

<p>The workshops will be prepared for Grades 3-6. If you're interesting in having Danny come to your school, please get in touch.</p>
